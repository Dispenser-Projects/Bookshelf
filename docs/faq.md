# ‚ùì FAQ

## Can I use the lib in my map/server project?

Of course! The lib is made for you to use it in your projects!

A mention of Bookshelf and/or Gunivers in a message of thanks is always welcome. Contribute to make the open-source world a respectful place! ü§ó

Also, don't hesitate to share us your creation in order to let us know how you use the lib (and let us give you some additional visibility to your project)! üòç

## What about copyrights?

The lib is under a license that allows you to use and modify it for your personal use and distribute a map or a datapack that uses the lib without any problem as long as you don't make money on it.
