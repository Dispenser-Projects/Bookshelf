### Get

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Block

```{function} #bs.hitbox:get_block

Get the hitbox of a block as a shape, represented by a list of boxes. Dimensions range from 0 to 16 as for models. This means that a full block will return the following: `[[0, 0, 0, 16, 16, 16]]`.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`**: Position from which to get the block hitbox.

:Outputs:
  **Scores `$hitbox.offset_[x,z] bs.out`**: Hitbox offset in miliblocks (used for exemple by flowers).

  **Storage `bs:out hitbox` [array]**: An array of cube coordinates.
```

*Get the hitbox of a stair:*

```mcfunction
setblock 0 0 0 minecraft:oak_stairs
execute positioned 0 0 0 run function #bs.hitbox:get_block
data get storage bs:out hitbox
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Entity

```{function} #bs.hitbox:get_entity

Get the width and height of an entity. For simplicity and optimization purposes this value is returned scaled by 1000.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity to get the hitbox from.

  **Execution `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`**: Position from which to get the entity hitbox.

:Outputs:
  **Score `@s bs.width`**: Height of the entity.

  **Score `@s bs.height`**: Width of the entity.
```

*Get the hitbox of an armor_stand:*

```mcfunction
execute summon minecraft:armor_stand run function #bs.hitbox:get_entity
execute as @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] run tellraw @a [{"text":"Height: ","color":"gray"},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.height"},"color":"gold"},{"text":", Width: "},{"score":{"name":"@s","objective":"bs.width"},"color":"gold"}]
```

```{important}
Static entities, such as paintings and item frames, do not provide height and width information. Instead, they return a shape similar to blocks in `bs:out hitbox`.
```
