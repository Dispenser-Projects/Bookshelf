## ðŸ”§ Functions

You can find below all the function available in this module.

---

### Aimed block

**`bs.view:aimed_block`**

Places an entity in the block the source is looking at.

:Inputs:

    (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities from which you want to get the aimed block.

:Outputs:

    (state) new entity created
    : The entity is created at the aimed block. It can be identified by the tag `bs.view.AimedBlock` and the score `bs.id.parent` corresponding to the ID of the entity executing the function. If there was already an entity with the tag `bs.view.AimedBlock` and the same `bs.id.parent`, it will be replaced.

    ```{admonition} In case there is no ID system
    :class: tip

    If you don't have an ID system, this function have to be used on 1 entity at a time. THe score `bs.id.parent` will then not be used. An ID system can be added using the [`bs.id` module](id).
    ```

:Example:

    Place in entity on the aimed block:

    ```
    # Once
    function bs.view:aimed_block
    ```

### Can see "as to at"

**`bs.view:can_see_ata`**

:Inputs:

    (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entities from which you want to know if they can see the execution position of the function.

    (execution) `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`
    : The position you want to know if the entities can see it.

:Outputs:

    (tag) `@s bs.view.CanSee`
    : The tag is added to the source entities that can see the execution position of the function.

:Example:

    Knowing whether an entity sees you:

    ```
    # Once
    execute as @e at @s run function bs.view:has_in_front_ata
    ```
