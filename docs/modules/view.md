## ðŸ”§ Functions

You can find below all functions available in this module.

---

### Aimed block

```{function} #bs.view:at_aimed_block

Run a command at the aligned coordinates of the block an entity is aiming at.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity whose eyes determine the vision origin.

  **Macro Var `run` [string]**: Command to run at the targeted block position.
```

*Change the block you are looking at:*

```mcfunction
# Once (will run if you are targeting a block)
function #bs.view:at_aimed_block {run:"setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:sponge"}
```

```{admonition} Advanced usage
:class: dropdown

This system is a simplified, specific use case of the `#bs.raycast:run` function. It internally relies on it, allowing you to read its output and providing the flexibility to alter its behavior by modifying its input. [Learn more here](raycast.md)

### Aimed entity

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} As

```{function} #bs.view:as_aimed_entity

Run a command as the entity that is aimed by the current entity.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity whose eyes determine the vision origin.

  **Macro Var `run` [string]**: Command to run as the targeted entity.

  **Tag**: Tag for entities that can be aimed (default: `bs.raycast.is_solid`).
```

*Run a command as the entity that you are looking at:*

function #bs.view:as_aimed_entity {run:"say I'm sorry, are you hitting on me?"}
```

:::
:::{tab-item} At

```{function} #bs.view:at_aimed_entity

Run a command at the entity that is aimed by the current entity.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity whose eyes determine the vision origin.

  **Macro Var `run` [string]**: Command to run at the targeted entity.

```{admonition} Advanced usage
:class: dropdown

This system is a simplified, specific use case of the `#bs.raycast:run` function. It internally relies on it, allowing you to read its output and providing the flexibility to alter its behavior by modifying its input. [Learn more here](raycast.md)
```

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

In Minecraft, predicates can check if a player is looking at an entity. If you only need a simple player specific check without the additional functionalities of the raycast, you should consider using the [Looked entity](#looked-entity) functions.

### Aimed point

```{function} #bs.view:at_aimed_point

Run a command at the point that was hit by the raycast.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Entity whose eyes determine the vision origin.

  **Macro Var `run` [string]**: Command to run at the hit point.
```

*Run a command at the point you are looking at:*

```mcfunction
# Once (will run if you are aiming at a solid block or entity)
function #bs.view:at_aimed_point {run:"particle minecraft:flame ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 0 1 force"}
```

```{admonition} Technical limitations
:class: important

As this function relies on a player specific predicate, it is exclusively designed for players. Additionally, to optimize performance, only a maximum of 255 entities are allowed to have the `bs.view.is_lookable` tag simultaneously.
```

### Placed block

```{function} #bs.view:at_placed_block

Run a command at the aligned coordinates of the block to be placed.

```mcfunction
# Once (will run if you are targeting a block)
function #bs.view:at_placed_block {run:"setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:sponge"}
```

```{admonition} Advanced usage
:class: dropdown

This system is a simplified, specific use case of the `#bs.raycast:run` function. It internally relies on it, allowing you to read its output and providing the flexibility to alter its behavior by modifying its input. [Learn more here](raycast.md)
```

```{admonition} Avoid the advancement
:class: important

This function simulates block placement but is discouraged for use with the `placed_block` advancement due to potential differences in precision compared to Minecraft. Rapid mouse movements during the same tick may also result in the wrong block being targeted.
