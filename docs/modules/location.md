### Add up coordinates

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Block

**`bs.location:add`**

Adds a relative position vector to the position of the executing entity, then teleports the entity to
this new position.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entity to teleport

    (score) `@s bs.loc.[rx,ry,rz]`
    : The relative position vector to move the entity

Outputs

:   (state) Entity position changed 
    : The entity position have been shifted from the relative position vector

Example

:   Move Aypierre by 3 blocks on the X axis, -2 on the Y axis and 5 on the Z axis

    ```
    scoreboard players set Aypierre bs.loc.x 3
    scoreboard players set Aypierre bs.loc.y -2

    execute as Aypierre at @s run function bs.location:add
    ```

:::

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

For several applications such as comparing distances, you can use the squared distance instead of the "normal" distance. It is faster to calculate because it avoid a square root computation, which is a bit heavy for a computer, especially in Minecraft.

```{admonition} Score limitation
:class: warning

The scores on Minecraft represent the size of an int variable in java. The latter is huge, but not unlimited. However, calculations involving powers give results that can quickly rise to more than billions, exceeding the size limit of the variable. The game will then have no choice but to ‚Äúloop‚Äù the value (if you exceed the limit of 1, the variable will go negative).

    (score) `@s bs.loc.[x,y,z]`
    : The coordinates to teleport to

Outputs

:   (state) Entity position
    : The entity has been teleported to the coordinates indicated by the scores

Example

:   Teleport in 15 100 25

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.x 15
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.y 100
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.z 25
    function bs.location:fast_set
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} Milliblock

**`bs.location:fast_set/scale/3`**

Allows to place the entity at a precise coordinate (with a milliblock accuracy) given by scores with a dichotomic teleport method that avoid some graphical lag induced by the /data command.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The entity to teleport

    (score) `@s bs.loc.[x,y,z]`
    : The coordinates (in milliblock) to teleport to

Outputs

:   (state) Entity position
    : The entity has been teleported to the coordinates indicated by the scores

Example

:   Teleport in 15.0 100.123 25.5

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.x 15000
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.y 100123
    scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.z 25500
    function bs.location:fast_set/scale/3
    ```

### Spread entity

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Normal

**`bs.location:spread`**

Allows to randomly teleport an entity in a given area.

Inputs

: (execution) `as <entities>`
  : The entities you want to spread

  (score) `@s bs.in.[0,1]`
  : Repectively the X and Z coordinates of the center of the area (in blocks)

  (score) `@s bs.in.2`
  : The radius of the area (in blocks)

Outputs

: (state) @s location
  : The entity was moved to a random position in the area

Example

: Teleport to an area with a radius of 10 blocks, having as its center the
  coordinate X=15, Z=25

  ```
  # Once
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.0 15
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.1 25
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.2 10
  function bs.location:spread
  ```

:::

:::{tab-item} Scale 3

**`bs.location:spread/accuracy/10-3`**

Allows to randomly teleport an entity in a given area.

Inputs

: (execution) `as <entities>`
  : The entities you want to spread

  (score) `@s bs.in.[0,1]`
  : Repectively the X and Z coordinates of the center of the area (in milliblocks)

  (score) `@s bs.in.2`
  : The radius of the area (in milliblocks)

Outputs

: (state) @s location
  : The entity was moved to a random position in the area

Example

: Teleport to an area with a radius of 10.003 blocks, having as its center the coordinate X=15.1, Z=25.502

  ```
  # Once
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.0 15100
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.1 25502
  scoreboard players set @s bs.in.2 10003
  function bs.location:spread/accuracy/10-3
  ```

```{admonition} What if we put a negative radius?
:class: tip

Obviously, it doesn't make sense to have a negative radius. However, during tests, we tried for you... and it have a surprisingly cool effect!

Due to mathematical properties in the computation that are performed, if you put a negative radius, your entites will be teleported somewhere between `(x,z)` and `(x+radius,z+radius)` instead of `(x-radius,z-radius)` and `(x+radius,z+radius)`.

Who knows, maybe it can be usefull for someone, so we let it as it is ^^
