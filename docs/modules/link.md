## ðŸ”§ Functions

You can find below all the function available in this module.

---

### Create link

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} As to at

**`bs.link:create_link_ata`**

In the same way as `create_link_to_target_id`, this function creates a link between the entity executing the function and the entity closest to the execution position.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The link lead on a parent-child relation. The executing (source) entity must be the child.

    (execution) `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`
    : The execution position is the position of the parent entity (the function will take the nearest entity).

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z,h,v]`
    : Representing the relative coordinates (position + orientation)

    (score) `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z]`
    : Representing local coordinates (position only)

    (score) `@s bs.link.to`
    : Identifies the entity to which it is linked

Example

:   Link all armor_stand to the nearest sheep

    ```
    # Once
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] at @e[type=sheep,limit=1,sort=nearest] run function bs.link:create_link_ata

    # See the result
    # In loop
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function glib_debug:link/display_link
    ```

:::
:::{tab-item} To target ID

**`bs.link:create_link_tti`**

Create a link between two entities : compute relative and local position and orientation in order to manipulate them later.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The link lead on a parent-child relation. The executing (source) entity must be the child.

    (score) `@s bs.id.target`
    : Score of the executing entity must match the `bs.id` score of the entity to which it will be linked. Multiple entities can be linked to a single entity (generally recommended for armor_stand structures).

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z,h,v]`
    : Representing the relative coordinates (position + orientation)

    (score) `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z]`
    : Representing local coordinates (position only)

    (score) `@s bs.link.to`
    : Identifies the entity to which it is linked

Example

:   Link all armor_stand to the entity with ID 3 (see the [`bs.id`](id) module to know how to assign an ID to an entity)

    ```
    # Once
    scorebaord players set @e[type=armor_stand] bs.id.target 3
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function bs.link:create_link_tti

    # See the result
    # In loop
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function glib_debug:link/display_link
    ```

:::
::::


```{note}
The output scores should generally not be directly modified because they are used as parameters for other link functions. It is then recommanded to only use the bookshelf function to modify these scores.
```

:class: dropdown

This function require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.id`](id)

```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This function require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.id`](id)
- [`bs.location`](location)
- [`bs.math`](math)
- [`bs.orientation`](orientation)
- [`bs.move`](move)
```

```{admonition} How does it work?
:class: dropdown

This reference frame, unlike the relative coordinates, takes into account the orientation of the entity. Thus, when the parent entity turns on itself, the child entity will turn around it keeping its distance and the angle formed between the direction of the parent entity's look and the parent->child vector.

### Update link

**`bs.link:update_link`**

This function allows to update the link between
entities. If you only use immitation and/or local position keeping
functions, this function will not be of any use to you. On the other
hand, if you change the position of the child entity automatically, you
will have to update the link so that your operation is not cancelled the
next time you call the link function.

```{admonition} Automatically updated

The link functions of the lib automatically call the update functions if necessary (example: reverse functions). No need to manage this on your side.
```

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The executing entity must be linked to another entity.

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.link.r[h,v]`
    : Representing the relative orientation (rotation only)

    (score) `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z]`
    : Representing the relative coordinates (position only)

    (score) `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z]`
    : Representing the local coordinates (position only)

Example

:   Update the armor_stands link

    ```
    # Once
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] run function bs.link:update_link

    # See the result
    # In a loop
    execute as @e[tag=bs.linked] run function glib_debug:link/display_link
    ```

```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This function require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.id`](id)
- [`bs.location`](location)
- [`bs.math`](math)
- [`bs.orientation`](orientation)
