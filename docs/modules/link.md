```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This module require the following modules to work properly:
- [`bs.id`](id)
- [`bs.math`](math)
- [`bs.position`](position)
```

---

## ðŸŽ“ Create behaviors

With this module you can combine multiple behaviors to create your very own custom one.

---

To create a new behavior, you first need to create a new function tag. The tag must start with `bs.link:behaviors/setup` and end with `bs.link:behaviors/apply`. Between those 2 functions you are free to use any behaviors that are provided inside the `bs.link:behaviors` folder.

Example

:   This is how `#bs.link:mirror_x_plane` is implemented inside bookshelf:

    ```json
    {
      "values": [
        "bs.link:behaviors/setup",
        "bs.link:behaviors/reverse_pos_x",
        "bs.link:behaviors/imitate_pos_y",
        "bs.link:behaviors/imitate_pos_z",
        "bs.link:behaviors/reverse_rot_h",
        "bs.link:behaviors/imitate_rot_v",
        "bs.link:behaviors/apply"
      ]
    }

    ```
---

## ðŸ”§ Functions

You can find below all the function available in this module.

---

### Create link

**`bs.link:create_link_ata`**

This function creates a link between the entity executing the function and the entity closest to the execution position.

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The link lead on a parent-child relation. The executing (source) entity must be the child.

    (execution) `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`
    : The execution position is the position of the parent entity (the function will take the nearest entity).

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z,h,v]`
    : Representing the relative coordinates (position + orientation).

    (score) `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z]`
    : Representing local coordinates (position only).

    (score) `@s bs.link.to`
    : Identifies the entity to which it is linked.

Example

:   Link all armor_stand to the nearest sheep:

    ```mcfunction
    # Once
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand] at @e[type=sheep,limit=1,sort=nearest] run function #bs.link:create_link_ata
    ```

```{note}
The output scores should generally not be directly modified because they are used as parameters for other link functions. It is then recommanded to only use the bookshelf function to modify these scores.

ðŸŽ¬ Watch a demo
```

```{admonition} How does it work?
:class: dropdown

This reference frame, unlike the relative coordinates, takes into account the rotation of the entity. Thus, when the parent entity turns on itself, the child entity will turn around it keeping its distance and the angle formed between the direction of the parent entity's look and the parent->child vector.

### Update link

**`#bs.link:update_link`**

This function allows to update the link between entities. If you only use immitation and/or local position keeping functions, this function will not be of any use to you. On the other hand, if you change the position of the child entity automatically, you will have to update the link so that your operation is not cancelled the next time you call the link function.

```{admonition} Automatically updated

The link functions of the lib automatically call the update functions if necessary (example: reverse functions). No need to manage this on your side.
```

Inputs

:   (execution) `as <entities>`
    : The executing entity must be linked to another entity.

Outputs

:   (score) `@s bs.link.r[h,v]`
    : Representing the relative orientation (rotation only).

    (score) `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z]`
    : Representing the relative coordinates (position only).

    (score) `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z]`
    : Representing the local coordinates (position only).

Example

:   Update armor_stands link:

    ```mcfunction
    # Once
    execute as @e[type=armor_stand,scores={bs.link.to=1..}] run function #bs.link:update_link
    ```
