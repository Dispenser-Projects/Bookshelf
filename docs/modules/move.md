## Move using vector

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Canonical

**`bs.move:by_vector`**

Allows to move the entity according to its vector on each
axis of the game.

:Inputs:

    (execution) `as <entity>`
    : The entity to move

    (scores) `@s bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The local vector you want the entity to move on (respectively left, up and forward vectors), shifted by 3 digits (1000 $\rightarrow$ move by 1 block)

    (scores) `@s bs.collision`
    : The collision behavior. Here is built-in behaviors:

        - `0` (default): The entity will cross all the blocks
        - `-1`: The entity will bounce on all the solid blocks
        - `-2`: The entity will stick and slide on the surface it will encounter
        - `-3`: The entity will stick and stop on all the solid blocks
        - `-4`: The entity will bounce on solid blocks and reduce the total speed by 2
        - `-101`, `-102`, `-103`, `-104` : same but useing head position instead of feet as the source of detection collision.

        ````{admonition} Create your own behavior!
        :class: dropdown

        It is possible to create your own collision behavior by creating the 3 following files:
        
        - `bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/heads/__switch__`: define the points where the detection will be done
        - `bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/detection/__switch__`: define how the detection will be done (which blocks)
        - `bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/behavior/__switch__`: define the behavior of the entity when a collision is detected

        These function will be called in this order when `@s bs.collision` $> 0$. They allow you to call the collision functions according to the corresponding `bs.collision` score. Here is the default switchers:

        ```mcfunction
        # bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/heads/__switch__
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -99..-1 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/heads/from_feet
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -199..-100 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/heads/from_player_head
        ```
        ```mcfunction
        # bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/detection/__switch__
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches ..-1 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/detection/solid_block_on_detection_head
        ```
        ```mcfunction
        # bs.config:move/by_vector/collision/behavior/__switch__
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -1 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/behavior/1-perfect_bounce
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -2 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/behavior/2-slide
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -3 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/behavior/3-stick
        execute if score @s bs.collision matches -4 run function bs.move:by_vector/child/collision/behavior/4-damped_bounce
        ```

        Here is below an example of what a `heads` function should looks like. Only the `bs.collision.detection.head` on each detection head entity in order to be correctly cleared afterward. This example is made to detect a collision of a point-like object by placing entites on 4 relevant directions : forward to detect a collision, and x, y and z to detect in which direction. As the detection is made before the movement, the detection heads are placed on the next position of the object.

        ```mcfunction
        # Executed on the moving object, at it's feet
        # Create detection heads on the moving object
        summon marker ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["bs.collision.detection.head","front"]}
        summon marker ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["bs.collision.detection.head","x"]}
        summon marker ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["bs.collision.detection.head","y"]}
        summon marker ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["bs.collision.detection.head","z"]}

        # Initializing the relative location to the object to 0
        execute as @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head] run scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.x 0
        execute as @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head] run scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.y 0
        execute as @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head] run scoreboard players set @s bs.loc.z 0

        # Vt.[x,y,z] is the current step vector used to move the entity.
        # Using these vector component to compute the relative position of the detection heads x, y and z
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=x] bs.loc.x = #Vt.x bs.data
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=y] bs.loc.y = #Vt.y bs.data
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=z] bs.loc.z = #Vt.z bs.data

        # Using the overhaul vector to compute the relative position of the detection head front (corresponding to the next moving object's position)
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=front] bs.loc.x = #Vt.x bs.data
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=front] bs.loc.y = #Vt.y bs.data
        scoreboard players operation @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=front] bs.loc.z = #Vt.z bs.data

        # Moving the detection heads to their relative position
        execute as @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head] at @s run function bs.location:add/scale/3
        ```

        Heres is an example of what a `detection` function should looks like, based on the heads function above. You can change the ignore blocks and potentially try to detect several block in a specific soncifugration to create more complex mecanics.

        ```mcfunction
        execute at @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=front] unless block ~ ~ ~ #bs.move:pass_through run tag @s add bs.collision
        execute if entity @s[tag=bs.collision] at @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=x] unless block ~ ~ ~ #bs.move:pass_through run tag @s add bs.collision.x
        execute if entity @s[tag=bs.collision] at @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=y] unless block ~ ~ ~ #bs.move:pass_through run tag @s add bs.collision.y
        execute if entity @s[tag=bs.collision] at @e[tag=bs.collision.detection.head,tag=z] unless block ~ ~ ~ #bs.move:pass_through run tag @s add bs.collision.z
        ```

        Finally, here is few examples of what a `behavior` function should looks like.

        Perfect bounce:
        ```mcfunction
        # The object will go in the opposite direction with the same speed on the axis it collided with.
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.x] bs.vector.x *= -1 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.y] bs.vector.y *= -1 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.z] bs.vector.z *= -1 bs.const
        ```

        Stick:
        ```mcfunction
        # The object will stop at the first block it hits
        scoreboard players set @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.x 0
        scoreboard players set @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.y 0
        scoreboard players set @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.z 0
        ```

        Dumped bounce:
        ```mcfunction	
        # The object will bounce but will lose half of it's speed each time it bounces.
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.x] bs.vector.x *= -1 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.y] bs.vector.y *= -1 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision.z] bs.vector.z *= -1 bs.const

        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.x /= 2 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.y /= 2 bs.const
        scoreboard players operation @s[tag=bs.collision] bs.vector.z /= 2 bs.const
        ```

        ````

:Option:

    (score) `@s bs.opt.0`
    : Precision of detection (in miliblock, so 500 -> 0.5 block). Default: 1000 (1 block)

:Outputs:

    (state) @s position
    : The new position of the entity

:Examples:

    Apply a movement of 0.3 blocks per tick in the X direction to all boats (simulating a sea current):

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.x 300
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.y 0
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.z 0

    # In loop
    execute as @e[type=boat] run function bs.move:by_vector
    ```

    Take into account collisions and make the boat stop, with a precision of 0.1 block:

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.x 300
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.y 0
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.z 0
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.collision 2
    tag @e[type=boat] add bs.config.override
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.precision 100

    # In loop
    execute as @e[type=boat] run function bs.move:by_vector
    ```

```{admonition} Dependencies
:class: dropdown

This function depends on:

- [**`bs.location`**](location)

```

:::
:::{tab-item} Local

**`bs.move:by_local_vector`**

Allows to move the entity according to its vector
on each axis of the local reference frame.

:Inputs:

    (execution) `as <entity>`
    : The entity to move

    (scores) `bs.vector.[x,y,z]`
    : The local vector you want the entity to move on (respectively left, up and forward vectors), shifted by 3 digits (1000 $\rightarrow$ move by 1 block)

:Outputs:

    (state) @s position
    : The new position of the entity



:Example:

    Apply a movement of 0.3 blocks per tick to the left to all boats:

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.x 300
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.y 0
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.z 0

    # In loop
    execute as @e[type=boat] run function bs.move:by_local_vector

```{admonition} Performance tip
:class: tip

The system does not include any speed limit. However, the
resources consumed by this function are proportional to the number
of blocks/tick at which the entity moves.
```

---

## Move forward

`forward`: Allows to move the entity according to the direction
towards which it looks and its vector `bs.vector.z`

* A vector of 1000 on an axis will cause a movement of one block at each execution of the function.
* The sum of the movements on each axis will give a movement in space (thus in 3 dimensions), corresponding to the global vector of the entity.
* * The system takes as input the 3 scores `bs.vector[Left,Up,Front]` (1000 <=> 1 block).

:::{warning}
The system does not include any speed limit. However, the
resources consumed by this function are proportional to the number
of blocks/tick at which the entity moves.
:::

*Example:*

-   Apply a movement of 0.3 blocks per tick forward to all boats:

    ```
    # Once
    scoreboard players set @e[type=boat] bs.vector.z 300

    # In a loop
    execute as @e[type=boat] run function bs.move:forward
    ```

--- 

## Find a path "as to at"

`pathfind_ata`: Allows to determine a path between the position of the
source entity and the execution position of the function.

* By default, the function will make 500 tests (defined via the `bs.in.1` score). This limit allow to avoid the function taking too many ressources if the path is too complexe or impossible to find.
* The behavior is defined by the variable `bs.in.3` which, by default is 0, corresponding to a behavior of a zombie, creeper, skeleton or a player (terrestrial entity of size 1*2*1).
   * When it is set to 1, the behavior will be similar to a bat.
   * You can create your own behaviors at any time in the `pathfind/config/` folder and link them in the `main.mcfunction` file in the same folder.
* The path is then defined by a succession of armor_stand with the tag "Glib_Pathfind_Rewind" and "Glib_Pathfind".

*Example:*

-   Find the path to the nearest armor_stand:

    ```
    # Once
    execute at @e[type=minecraft:armor_stand,limit=1,sort=nearest] run function bs.move:pathfind_ata
    ```

## Convert vector to motion

`vector_to_motion`: Allows to move the entity according to its vector
through a motion (motion system integrated in the game).

* A vector of 1000 on an axis will move a block at each tick of the game.
* The sum of the movements on each axis will give a movement in space (thus in 3 dimensions), corresponding to the global vector of the entity.

:::{note}
This system admits a speed limit corresponding to that of the
Motions. Moreover, the entity will have by default a collision
system preventing it from crossing blocks. Moreover, adding Marker,
NoAI, NoGravity tags can block this system. Collisions are
integrated in this system but are not very reliable and therefore
not recommended. Only activated when the entity has a Collision
score greater than 1 (each value corresponds to a type of
collision). You can modify the collision reactions or create your
own in the `by_vector/config/collision/` folder. By default, the
precision of the collisions, stored on the Var5 score, is 500 (= 0,5
blocks). }}
