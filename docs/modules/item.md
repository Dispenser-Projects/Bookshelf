# ‚õèÔ∏è Item

**`bs.item:_`**

Systems allowing to manipulate items

```{admonition} Heavy module
:class: warning

This module use search trees, that perform very fast operations that have not been considered in the current Minecraft commands system. The counterpart of such systems is that they use thousands of similar files. Thus, we highly recomended you to keep the datapack compressed when you use this module. A simple zip compression is enough to drastically reduce the size of the datapack and the number of files will no longer be a problem.
