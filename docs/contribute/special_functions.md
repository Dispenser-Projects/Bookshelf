# ðŸŒŸ Special functions

##  ðŸ‘‰ The "ata" functions

This is a reduction of "as to at". Several functions require 2 positions to work (example: retrieve the distance between 2 points) or an entity and a position. To simplify the use, no need to pass 3 scores for each position. You will be able to place an entity on point 1 (if it is useful), then execute the function on point 2 by executing it on the entity on point 1.

## ðŸ†” The "tti" functions

This is a reduction of "to target id". Several functions require 2 a source and a target entity (example: get a vector to another entity). To simplify the use, no need to always use the `id/check` function.
